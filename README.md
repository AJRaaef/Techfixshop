# 🛠️ TechFix Procurement Management System

## 📖 Overview

**TechFix** is a local computer repair and custom PC shop that faces challenges in its manual procurement process. This application addresses key inefficiencies—such as inconsistent pricing, lack of inventory visibility, and error-prone order management—through a **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** solution.

The system integrates supplier data, automates quote and order processes, and provides real-time inventory access—all from a centralized platform.
